# Winsor Wildbots FTC

Hey Wildbots coders! So almost everything you need to know about the app is in the
official FTC README file, but seeing as we've made a few changes to the code
and have added various libraries and dependencies, it seems like a good idea
to keep this updated, especially for people who want to learn to code and are
added to the repo later. This will be a basic description of what we've
changed, extra info that might not be in the other README, and anything else
to help out current and future coders.

## Downloading the Project

Yes yes, this section is in the other README, but what the other file doesn't
tell you is that after you git clone this project and import it to Android
Studio, you will get an error that you probably don't understand. Fortunately,
because the IDE is so clever, it offers an immediate solution. Basically, keep
clickling those blue links under the error messages until there are no more.
If you add more dependencies and libraries further down the line, you may
discover that the gradle files will force you to go through this process a few
times.

### Windows Users

I haven't figured out how to deal with this yet, but just know that if you use
Windows everything will break which is why Apple is better.
